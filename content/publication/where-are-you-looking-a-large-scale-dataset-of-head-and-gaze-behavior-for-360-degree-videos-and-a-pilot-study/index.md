abstract: "60° videos in recent years have experienced booming develop\x02ment.
  Compared to traditional videos, 360° videos are featured

  with uncertain user behaviors, bringing opportunities as well as

  challenges. Datasets are necessary for researchers and developers

  to explore new ideas and conduct reproducible analyses for fair

  comparisons among different solutions. However, existing related

  datasets mostly focused on users’ field of view (FoV), ignoring the

  more important eye gaze information, not to mention the integrated

  extraction and analysis of both FoV and eye gaze. Besides, users’

  behavior patterns are highly related to videos, yet most existing

  datasets only contained videos with subjective and qualitative
  clas\x02sification from video genres, which lack quantitative analysis and

  fail to characterize the intrinsic properties of a video scene"
