abstract: "360° panoramic videos in recent years have experienced booming

  development due to the immersive and interactive experience. Com\x02pared to
  traditional videos, 360° videos are featured with uncertain

  user field of view (FoV), more stringent delay tolerance, and much

  higher bandwidth requirement, bringing unprecedented challenges

  to 360° video streaming. The development of 5G and mobile edge

  computing paves the way for high-bandwidth low-latency video

  streaming, yielding some preliminary works focusing on either in\x02dividual
  FoV prediction or multi-user QoE oriented cache strategy

  design. Yet how to design a holistic solution toward optimizing

  overall user QoE with fairness and long-term system cost remains a

  non-trivial problem.\n"
