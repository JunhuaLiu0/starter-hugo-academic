# About me

![fniilogo-2-.png](sum2.png)

He is currently a B.S. student in data science at [the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn). I have committed myself to computer science research and innovation. 

His research interests mainly focus on the following two aspects:

* Vision: 3D vision, Virtual Reality, multimodal, video prediction.
* System - Edge AI, network and multimedia system.

He is lucky to be a research assistant in INML supervised by [Prof.Fangxin Wang](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/wangfangxin/publications.html) focused on multimedia system and VR. Besides, He is also a research assistant in Harvard CAMLab supervised by [Prof. Huazhe Xu](http://hxu.rocks/), and work with [Jiashun Wang](https://jiashunwang.github.io/), focused on 3D motion generation and 3D reconstruction.
