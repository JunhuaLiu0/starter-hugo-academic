## About me

He is currently a second-year B.S. student in computer science at [the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn). I have committed myself to computer science research and innovation. 

His research interests mainly focus on the following two aspects:

* Vision: 3D vision, Virtual Reality, multimodal, video prediction.
* System - Video streaming, video ananlysis, Edge AI, network and multimedia system.

He is lucky to be a research assistant in [FNii](https://fnii.cuhk.edu.cn/) supervised by [Prof. Fangxin Wang](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/wangfangxin/publications.html). Besides, He also works with [Prof. Huazhe Xu](http://hxu.rocks/), [Prof. Zeyu Wang](https://zachzeyuwang.github.io/), [Prof. Yan Wang](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1046/1379.html), [Jiashun Wang](https://jiashunwang.github.io/), [Chengan He](http://cs.yale.edu/homes/che/) in Harvard CAMLab, Tsinghua IIIS, and SenseTime.
