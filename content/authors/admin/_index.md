## About me

He is currently a second-year B.S. student in computer science at [the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn). He is lucky to be a research assistant in [Future Network of Intelligence Institute](https://fnii.cuhk.edu.cn/) supervised by [Prof. Fangxin Wang](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/wangfangxin/publications.html). Besides, He is also lucky to work with [Prof. Huazhe Xu](http://hxu.rocks/), [Prof. Zeyu Wang](https://zachzeyuwang.github.io/), [Prof. Yan Wang](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1046/1379.html), Yili Jin, [Jiashun Wang](https://jiashunwang.github.io/), [Chengan He](http://cs.yale.edu/homes/che/) in Harvard CAMLab, Tsinghua IIIS, and SenseTime.\
His research interest lies at **the intersection of Multimedia system, vision, and robot learning**, seeking potential applications like **Metaverse**, **Automatic drive,** and **Embodied AI**. For example, the following two aspects: 
* AIoT: Video streaming, CODEC, and analysis, Edge computing.
* Vision: 3D vision, VR, multimodal, video prediction.

I am actively seeking the opportunity of **Summer Research** in **2023.**
